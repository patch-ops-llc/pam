PatchOps Team Bonus Plan
Effective: January 2025

Overview
We're implementing a monthly bonus structure to reward the team for hitting our client quotas and going above and beyond. This plan has three components:

Team Partner Quotas — Everyone benefits when we hit a partner's monthly hours target
Individual Quota — Personal bonus for hitting your own monthly hours goal
Overage Bonus — Extra pay for every hour logged beyond your individual quota


Bonus Structure
Team Partner Bonuses
When the team collectively hits a partner's monthly hours quota, everyone receives a bonus:
PartnerFull-TimePart-TimeDomestique$150$75New Edge$150$75Instrumental$150$75
Example: If we hit quota for Domestique and Instrumental but miss New Edge, everyone receives $150 (FT) or $75 (PT) for each of those two partners.
Future Partners: Any new partners added will follow this same bonus structure — team quota bonus and overage rates will apply consistently.
Team Accountability: Partner quotas include fulfillment of prebilled commitments (retainers and fixed-fee projects). A partner quota is only considered "hit" if:

Retainer hours are fully delivered
Fixed-fee project work is delivered on time and to spec
Client sentiment remains positive (at leadership's discretion)

If these conditions aren't met, the team bonus for that partner is not paid out — even if total hours were logged.

Individual Quota Bonus
Hit your personal monthly hours quota and receive:
Full-TimePart-Time$300$150

Overage Bonus
For every hour logged beyond your individual quota:
Rate$5 / hour
This applies to all team members equally, regardless of FT/PT status.

Future Quota Adjustments
As our partnerships grow, partner quotas may increase. When a partner's quota increases:
For each partner quota increase, the team bonus for that partner will increase by $2.50/hour (based on the quota hour increase).
This ensures your bonus potential grows alongside our client commitments.
